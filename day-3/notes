State property will only be exists in class based component
With react 16.8 - released react hooks which can be used in functinal component
this.render will be called automatically
Props or State change will lead to rerender dom.
Props allow you to pass data from parent to child

onclick - normal html and onclick - in jsx
Handler is the convention to give event handler
for example switchNameHandler -  arrow function
to refer this to our class we are using arrow function
dont pass parenthesis to the function - pass only reference

switchNameHandler = () => {
	console.log('was clicked');
	this.state.persons[0].name = 'Saurabh';
}

above code give warning: - dont mutate state

We should not mutate state, react will not recognize this change.

Use setState method of component class

Questions:
1. can we pass our custom component in children props?
2. can we change change for single element of array if we have array of elements inside state?
